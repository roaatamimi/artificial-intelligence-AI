# Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains two deep reinforcement learning implementations:

**Deep Convolutional Q-Learning for Pac-Man**: An AI agent that learns to play Pac-Man using convolutional neural networks to process raw game screen images, making decisions about navigation and ghost avoidance through visual input.

**Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing**: A reinforcement learning agent trained on OpenAI Gym's LunarLander environment that learns to control spacecraft engines for safe lunar landings, optimizing landing accuracy and fuel efficiency.

Both projects demonstrate neural network-based Q-learning algorithms solving complex sequential decision-making problems in gaming and control systems.
